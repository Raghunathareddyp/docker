Docker swarm schedule the tasks, a task is a running container which
is part of swarm service and managed by swarm manager

Docker swarm works to maintain desired state, if any worker node becomes
unavailable then docker schedules that node tasks to another node.

stand alone conatainers and swarm - main difference is who manges conatainers
in case of stand alone docker daemon , in case of swarm - swarm manager.

To deploy your application to a swarm, you submit a service definition to a manager node. 
The manager node dispatches units of work called tasks to worker nodes.

service is the definition of the tasks to execute on the manager or worker nodes
replicated services - as per the desired state
global services - task on every node of swarm like

A task carries a Docker container and the commands to run inside the container. 
It is the atomic scheduling unit of swarm
